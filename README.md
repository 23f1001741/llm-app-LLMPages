# GitHub Pages Project

Welcome to the GitHub Pages Project, a unique repository containing an eclectic collection of files, each serving distinct purposes. This project explores various creative and data-driven pieces ranging from a fictional short story inspired by Brandon Sanderson to JSON files presenting ethical dilemmas and economic predictions. Additionally, it features visual and descriptive content including an SVG of a pelican on a bicycle and a special restaurant recommendation in Bangalore.

## How It Works

- **dilemma.json**: Consider moral choices facing modern technology with a JSON file that evaluates an autonomous vehicle's decision-making.
- **about.md**: Uncover a self-descriptive snippet presented succinctly in three words.

- **restaurant.json**: Savor suggestions with a JSON guide to one of Bangalore's finest dining spots.
- **prediction.json**: Engage in financial forecasting with insights on the Fed Funds rate projected for December 2025.
- **LICENSE**: View the permissions and rights provided under the MIT License.
